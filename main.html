	<h1>Understanding Time and Space Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity refers to the amount of time an algorithm takes to run as a function of the size of its input. It helps evaluate the efficiency of an algorithm by estimating how its runtime grows with input siz. A lower time complexity generally indicates a faster algorithm and efficient code. Analyzing time complexity is crucial for understanding how an algorithm will scale and perform under larger inputs.</p>
	<p><b>Space Complexity</b> measures the amount of memory an algorithm requires during its execution, relative to the size of the input. It includes both the memory used by the input data and any extra space allocated for variables, data structures, or function calls. For example O(n). Optimizing space complexity is important in environments with limited memory or when dealing with large-scale data.</p>
